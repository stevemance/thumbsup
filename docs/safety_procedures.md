   1. Place robot in test box
   2. Clear surrounding area
   3. Connect weapon ESC power
   4. Stand clear (minimum 3 feet)
   5. Verify failsafe works
   ```

3. **Arming Sequence**:
   ```
   1. Hold gamepad X + Y buttons
   2. Wait for armed LED
   3. Check armed indicator flashing
   4. Test at low throttle first
   ```

## Operating Safety Rules

### ALWAYS

✅ **DO**:
- Keep weapon pointed away from people
- Maintain safe distance (3+ feet)
- Use emergency stop if unsure
- Power down when not competing
- Have spotter present
- Communicate clearly with others

### NEVER

❌ **DON'T**:

- Operate without test box/arena
- Leave armed unattended
- Touch moving parts
- Disable failsafes
- Operate with damaged components

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Stop Methods

1. **Software E-Stop**:
   - Press L1 + R1 simultaneously
   - Immediately disarms weapon
   - Stops all motors

2. **Connection Loss**:
   - Turn off gamepad
   - 500ms failsafe triggers
   - All motors stop

3. **Physical Disconnect**:
   - Pull main battery connector
   - Last resort method
   - Use if other methods fail

### Fire Response

**LiPo Battery Fire**:
1. Do NOT use water
2. Use Class D extinguisher or sand
3. Move to safe outdoor area if possible
4. Call emergency services if severe
5. Allow to burn out in safe location

### Injury Protocol

2. Assess injury severity
3. Apply first aid as needed
4. Seek medical attention for:
   - Any cuts from weapon
   - Burns from batteries/ESCs
   - Eye injuries

## Battery Safety

### Charging

- Use LiPo-specific charger only
- Never exceed 1C charge rate
- Monitor during charging
- Charge in fireproof bag/container
- Balance charge regularly

### Storage

- Store at 3.7-3.8V per cell
- Cool, dry location
- Fireproof container
- Check monthly
- Dispose of damaged batteries properly

### Warning Signs

**Stop using battery if**:
- Swelling/puffing visible
- Physical damage present
- Voltage imbalance >0.1V
- Gets hot during use
- Won't hold charge

## Competition Safety

### Pre-Match

1. **Tech Inspection**:
   - Have safety equipment ready
   - Demonstrate failsafe
   - Show emergency stop
   - Verify weight compliance

2. **Staging Area**:
   - Keep weapon disarmed
   - Point weapon down/away
   - Maintain control at all times
   - Communicate with staff

### During Match

1. **Safe Operation**:
