## Safety Features

### Startup Safety Tests
The robot performs 6 critical safety tests on every startup:

1. **Motor Initialization** - Verifies all motors start in safe positions
2. **Weapon Safety** - Confirms weapon starts disarmed and interlocks work
3. **Failsafe System** - Tests signal loss detection (1.5 second timeout)
4. **Battery Monitoring** - Validates voltage sensing and thresholds
5. **Emergency Stop** - Verifies E-stop functionality
6. **Overflow Protection** - Ensures calculation safety

If any test fails, the robot enters lockout mode with rapid LED flashing and will not operate.

### Runtime Safety Features
- **Connection failsafe** - Motors stop after 1.5s signal loss
- **Low battery protection** - Weapon disabled below 11.1V
- **Emergency stop** - L1+R1 instantly stops all motors
- **Continuous monitoring** - Safety checks run every 10ms
- **Violation counting** - Multiple violations trigger automatic shutdown

## Building the Firmware

### Prerequisites

1. Install the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
cd pico-sdk
git submodule update --init
export PICO_SDK_PATH=$PWD
```

2. Install Bluepad32:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32.git
cd bluepad32
git submodule update --init
export BLUEPAD32_ROOT=$PWD
```

3. Install required tools:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi build-essential
# Install picotool for UF2 generation
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool.git
cd picotool
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
sudo make install
```

### Build Process

1. Set environment variables:
```bash
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk
export BLUEPAD32_ROOT=/path/to/bluepad32
```

2. Navigate to the firmware directory:
```bash
cd thumbsup/firmware
```

3. Create build directory and configure:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DPICO_SDK_PATH=$PICO_SDK_PATH
```

4. Build the firmware:
```bash
make -j8
```

4. The output file `thumbsup.uf2` will be in the build directory.

## Flashing the Firmware

1. Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico W
2. Connect the Pico W to your computer via USB
3. Release the BOOTSEL button
4. The Pico will appear as a USB drive
5. Copy `thumbsup.uf2` to the drive
6. The Pico will automatically reboot with the new firmware

## AM32 ESC Configuration

The weapon ESC needs specific configuration for optimal performance:

### Using AM32 Configurator

1. Download AM32 Configurator from [GitHub](https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware)
2. Connect the ESC to your computer using a USB-serial adapter
3. Apply these settings:

```
Motor Direction: Forward
Brake on Stop: OFF
Motor Timing: 16 degrees
Startup Power: Medium
PWM Frequency: 24kHz
Temperature Protection: 80Â°C
Low Voltage Cutoff: Disabled (managed by robot firmware)
Throttle Calibration: 1000-2000Î¼s
Signal Type: Normal PWM
```

## Safety Procedures

### Pre-Competition Checklist

1. **Battery Check**: Ensure battery voltage > 10V
2. **Connection Test**: Verify gamepad connects automatically
3. **Failsafe Test**: Turn off controller, verify motors stop
4. **Weapon Arm**: Test arm sequence (X+Y hold)
5. **Emergency Stop**: Test L1+R1 disarm

### Operating Procedures

1. Power on robot with weapon ESC disconnected
2. Verify drive functions correctly
3. Connect weapon ESC
4. Arm weapon only when in combat arena
5. Always disarm before handling robot

## Troubleshooting

### Bluetooth Connection Issues
- Ensure controller is in pairing mode (varies by controller type)
- Check STATUS LED for connection state
- Reset Pico if connection fails after 10 seconds
- Bluepad32 automatically handles pairing for supported controllers
- For first-time pairing, controller may need to be in discovery mode

### Motor Not Responding
- Verify PWM signal with oscilloscope/logic analyzer
- Check ESC power and ground connections
- Ensure ESC is calibrated for 1000-2000Î¼s range

### Weapon Won't Arm
- Check battery voltage (must be > 9.6V)
- Verify arm sequence is held for full duration
- Check ARMED LED for feedback

## Development

### Debug Mode

Debug output is enabled by default. Connect via serial terminal (115200 baud) to see:
- Bluepad32 controller detection and pairing status
- Gamepad input values
- System state changes

To disable debug output, remove `DEBUG_MODE=1` from the source files.

### Modifying Parameters

Edit `firmware/include/config.h` to adjust:
- Control deadzones
- Speed limits
- Exponential curves
- Timing constants
- Safety thresholds

### Bluetooth Platform Customization

The Bluepad32 platform implementation is in `firmware/src/bluetooth_platform.c`.
Modify the callbacks to customize:
- Controller mapping
- Input processing
- Special button combinations
- Rumble/LED feedback
